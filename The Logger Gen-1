## Tag Naming Convention
- Use **lowercase** and **hyphens** for multi-word tags (e.g., `feature`, `bug`, `user-auth`, `urgent`, `frontend`, `backend`).
- Be consistent to enable easy searching and filtering.

# Workflow-Based Intelligence System  
**Name:** The Logger gen-1

The Logger Gen-1 always checks for a `PRD.md` (Project Requirements Document) at the start of every session. If it doesn't exist, you'll be prompted to create one using the template below.  
The logger also ensures all other workflow files are present, creating them if missing. This guarantees you never start work without project vision and context.

---

## 🚨 If PRD.md is Missing: Use AI to Create It (Do This Outside Cursor!)

**Do NOT proceed until PRD.md exists.**

1. **Use ChatGPT (or any LLM) to get a high-level summary of your project:**
   - Paste your README, main code, or any available docs and ask:  
     _"Summarize the purpose, main features, and goals of this project."_

2. **Copy the summary to Claude (free version) and ask:**  
   _"Using this summary, create a Project Requirements Document (PRD) in markdown format with sections for Vision, Goals, Success Criteria, and Current Phase."_

3. **Review and edit the PRD draft to ensure it matches your project's intent.**

4. **Save the final version as `PRD.md` in your project root.**

5. **Only then proceed with the rest of the logger workflow.**

**Why?**  
- Cursor and most AI tools work best when a clear PRD is present.
- Creating the PRD outside Cursor ensures you have a strong, human-reviewed project vision before you start logging tasks or progress.

**Remember:**  
- The logger will not function as intended without a PRD.md.
- Always keep PRD.md up to date as your project evolves.

---

> This ensures every user, new or returning, always starts with a clear, AI-generated, and human-reviewed project vision!

## 🎯 **The Flow Logic:**

1. **Check NEXT_TASK.md** → What should I work on?
2. **Check TASK_TRACKER.md** → Where did I leave off?
3. **Check PRD.md** → Does current work align with vision?
4. **IF aligned** → Execute next task
5. **IF misaligned** → Check ERROR_LOGS.md + PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md to understand why
6. **Understand context** → Plan → Execute
7. **Update relevant files** based on what happened

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start (2 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Create Files**
```bash
touch REFERENCE_INDEX.md NEXT_TASK.md TASK_TRACKER.md PRD.md ERROR_LOGS.md PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md PROJECT_FILES.md
```

### **Step 2: Start Your Workflow**
1. **Create and fill out REFERENCE_INDEX.md first** (see template below)
2. **Define your vision** in PRD.md
3. **Set your next task** in NEXT_TASK.md
4. **Track your progress** in TASK_TRACKER.md
5. **Follow the flow logic** above
6. **Use semantic tags in every entry** (see templates for the `Tags:` field)

---

## 🚨 **Critical: Validate Your Setup**
After creating files, verify:
- [ ] REFERENCE_INDEX.md exists and has content
- [ ] PRD.md exists and has content
- [ ] All 7 files are in project root
- [ ] You can access all files quickly
- [ ] Templates are populated (not empty)
- [ ] **Semantic tags are present in every entry** (check for `Tags:` fields)

---

## 🎯 **First Time? Start Here**
1. **Create files** using the touch command
2. **Copy templates** from this document into each file
3. **Fill REFERENCE_INDEX.md first** - this is mandatory
4. **Fill PRD.md**
5. **Set one simple task** in NEXT_TASK.md
6. **Start TASK_TRACKER.md** with today's date
7. **Begin working** and update as you go
8. **Add tags to every entry** (e.g., `Tags: feature, urgent`)

---

## ⚠️ **Common Setup Mistakes**
- **Empty files**: Don't leave templates empty - copy the content
- **Wrong location**: Files must be in project root
- **Skipping PRD**: You cannot proceed without PRD.md
- **No daily routine**: Update TASK_TRACKER.md throughout the day
- **Missing tags**: Every entry in your workflow files should have a `Tags:` field

---

## 📋 **Daily Quick Reference**
**Morning:**
- Check NEXT_TASK.md
- Open TASK_TRACKER.md
- Quick PRD alignment check
- **Review tags in your entries**

**During work:**
- Update TASK_TRACKER.md every 30 min
- Log errors immediately
- Update PROJECT_FILES.md for file changes
- **Add/update tags as needed**

**Evening:**
- Complete TASK_TRACKER.md
- Set tomorrow's task in NEXT_TASK.md
- Quick alignment review
- **Check that all new entries have tags**

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**
**"I don't know what to work on"**
- Check PRD.md for vision
- Review ERROR_LOGS.md for patterns
- Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md for changes

**"I keep getting stuck"**
- Are you following the flow logic?
- Have you logged recent errors?
- Is your current task in NEXT_TASK.md?

**"The system feels like overhead"**
- Start with just 3 files: PRD.md, NEXT_TASK.md, TASK_TRACKER.md
- Update TASK_TRACKER.md only when you stop/start
- Add other files as you need them

---

## 🌟 **How to Know It's Working**
You'll know the system is working when:
- You never ask "what was I working on?"
- You catch alignment issues before they become problems
- You can explain your project vision in 30 seconds
- You have a clear record of what went wrong and how you fixed it
- New team members can understand your project immediately

# RULES.md – Workflow & Semantic Tagging Rules

```markdown
# Logger Gen-1 Rules

## 1. Semantic Tagging
- Every entry in NEXT_TASK.md, TASK_TRACKER.md, ERROR_LOGS.md, and PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md should include a **Tags:** field.
- Tags should be short keywords or phrases that describe the context, topic, or type of entry (e.g., `auth`, `bug`, `feature`, `urgent`, `frontend`, `backend`).
- This enables fast searching, filtering, and AI understanding.

## 2. File Creation & CRUD
- Whenever a new file is created, modified, or deleted, update PROJECT_FILES.md and include semantic tags for the file's purpose and relationships.

## 3. PRD Enforcement
- The logger must not proceed unless PRD.md exists and is up to date.

## 4. Flow Logic Enforcement
- Always follow the flow logic as described in the main documentation.
- If a new workflow pattern emerges, add it to this RULES.md file.

---
```

---

## 🔄 **The Workflow in Action**

### **Starting Your Day**
1. **Open NEXT_TASK.md** - See what you should work on
2. **Open TASK_TRACKER.md** - Remember where you left off
3. **Quick PRD check** - Ensure alignment with vision
4. **Start working** - Execute your next task

### **File CRUD Operations**
**When you create a new file:**
1. **Create the file**
2. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Project Files" section
3. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Recent File Changes"
4. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Document relationships if any

**When you modify a file:**
1. **Make your changes**
2. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Recent File Changes"
3. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Update relationships if changed

**When you delete a file:**
1. **Delete the file**
2. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Remove from "Project Files" section
3. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Recent File Changes"
4. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Remove from relationships

### **During Work**
1. **Update TASK_TRACKER.md** as you progress
2. **Log errors** in ERROR_LOGS.md immediately
3. **Note changes** in PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md if vision shifts
4. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** when creating/modifying/deleting files
5. **Check alignment** if you feel stuck

### **When You Get Stuck**
1. **Check ERROR_LOGS.md** - Have you seen this before?
2. **Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - Has the vision changed?
3. **Re-read PRD.md** - Are you still aligned?
4. **Update NEXT_TASK.md** - Adjust priorities if needed

### **End of Day**
1. **Complete TASK_TRACKER.md** - Document where you stopped
2. **Update NEXT_TASK.md** - Set tomorrow's priority
3. **Review alignment** - Are you still on track?

---

## 🎯 **Alignment Checks**

### **Before Major Decisions**
- **Check PRD.md** - Does this align with vision?
- **Check ERROR_LOGS.md** - Have we tried this before?
- **Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - How has the project changed?

### **When Feeling Lost**
- **Re-read PRD.md** - What are we actually building?
- **Check NEXT_TASK.md** - What should I focus on?
- **Review ERROR_LOGS.md** - What patterns am I repeating?

### **When Priorities Feel Wrong**
- **Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - Has the vision evolved?
- **Update PRD.md** if needed - Is the vision still correct?
- **Adjust NEXT_TASK.md** - Set new priorities

---

## 🤖 **AI Assistant Integration**

### **For Cursor/Claude/GPT**
When working with AI assistants:

1. **Share PRD.md** - Give them your vision
2. **Share NEXT_TASK.md** - Tell them your current focus
3. **Share TASK_TRACKER.md** - Show them where you left off
4. **Share PROJECT_FILES.md** - Show them all project files and relationships
5. **Ask for alignment check** - "Does this align with our vision?"
6. **Update files** based on their suggestions
7. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** if they suggest new files or changes

### **AI Communication Template**
```
"Here's my project vision (PRD.md), my current task (NEXT_TASK.md), 
where I left off (TASK_TRACKER.md), and all project files (PROJECT_FILES.md). 

Can you help me with [specific question] while ensuring 
we stay aligned with the vision?"
```

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **Keep It Simple**
- **Update TASK_TRACKER.md** every 30 minutes
- **Log errors immediately** - don't wait
- **Check alignment** when you feel stuck
- **Trust the flow** - it works

### **When to Update Each File**
- **NEXT_TASK.md** - When priorities change
- **TASK_TRACKER.md** - Throughout your work session
- **PRD.md** - When vision changes (rarely)

## FAQ

**Q: How do I find all files related to a feature or bug?**
A: Check REFERENCE_INDEX.md and look for tags or relationships. Use the tags and relationships sections to quickly locate all relevant files.

**Q: What if I need to understand how multiple files work together?**
A: REFERENCE_INDEX.md documents file relationships. Review the "File Relationships" section for dependencies and data flow.

**Q: What tags should I use?**
A: Use short, descriptive, lowercase tags. For multi-word tags, use hyphens (e.g., `user-auth`, `data-import`). See the Tag Naming Convention above for details.

**Q: What if I forget to add tags?**
A: Review the onboarding and daily checklists—they remind you to add tags to every entry. Tags are required for searchability and AI context.

**Q: How do I get full project context?**
A: Always start with REFERENCE_INDEX.md to see the big picture, then open the specific files listed there. Use tags to filter and find what you need.
