# Workflow-Based Intelligence System:
Name : The Logger gen-1

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Flow Logic:**

1. **Check NEXT_TASK.md** â†’ What should I work on?
2. **Check TASK_TRACKER.md** â†’ Where did I leave off?
3. **Check PRD.md** â†’ Does current work align with vision?
4. **IF aligned** â†’ Execute next task
5. **IF misaligned** â†’ Check ERROR_LOGS.md + PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md to understand why
6. **Understand context** â†’ Plan â†’ Execute
7. **Update relevant files** based on what happened

## ðŸš€ **Quick Start (2 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Create Files**
```bash

```

### **Step 2: Start Your Workflow**
1. **Define your vision** in PRD.md
2. **Set your next task** in NEXT_TASK.md
3. **Track your progress** in TASK_TRACKER.md
4. **Follow the flow logic** above

## ðŸ”„ **The Workflow in Action**

### **Starting Your Day**
1. **Open NEXT_TASK.md** - See what you should work on
2. **Open TASK_TRACKER.md** - Remember where you left off
3. **Quick PRD check** - Ensure alignment with vision
4. **Start working** - Execute your next task

### **File CRUD Operations**
**When you create a new file:**
1. **Create the file**
2. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Project Files" section
3. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Recent File Changes"
4. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Document relationships if any

**When you modify a file:**
1. **Make your changes**
2. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Recent File Changes"
3. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Update relationships if changed

**When you delete a file:**
1. **Delete the file**
2. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Remove from "Project Files" section
3. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Add to "Recent File Changes"
4. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** - Remove from relationships

### **During Work**
1. **Update TASK_TRACKER.md** as you progress
2. **Log errors** in ERROR_LOGS.md immediately
3. **Note changes** in PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md if vision shifts
4. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** when creating/modifying/deleting files
5. **Check alignment** if you feel stuck

### **When You Get Stuck**
1. **Check ERROR_LOGS.md** - Have you seen this before?
2. **Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - Has the vision changed?
3. **Re-read PRD.md** - Are you still aligned?
4. **Update NEXT_TASK.md** - Adjust priorities if needed

### **End of Day**
1. **Complete TASK_TRACKER.md** - Document where you stopped
2. **Update NEXT_TASK.md** - Set tomorrow's priority
3. **Review alignment** - Are you still on track?

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **Alignment Checks**

### **Before Major Decisions**
- **Check PRD.md** - Does this align with vision?
- **Check ERROR_LOGS.md** - Have we tried this before?
- **Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - How has the project changed?

### **When Feeling Lost**
- **Re-read PRD.md** - What are we actually building?
- **Check NEXT_TASK.md** - What should I focus on?
- **Review ERROR_LOGS.md** - What patterns am I repeating?

### **When Priorities Feel Wrong**
- **Check PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - Has the vision evolved?
- **Update PRD.md** if needed - Is the vision still correct?
- **Adjust NEXT_TASK.md** - Set new priorities

---

## ðŸ¤– **AI Assistant Integration**

### **For Cursor/Claude/GPT**
When working with AI assistants:

1. **Share PRD.md** - Give them your vision
2. **Share NEXT_TASK.md** - Tell them your current focus
3. **Share TASK_TRACKER.md** - Show them where you left off
4. **Share PROJECT_FILES.md** - Show them all project files and relationships
5. **Ask for alignment check** - "Does this align with our vision?"
6. **Update files** based on their suggestions
7. **Update PROJECT_FILES.md** if they suggest new files or changes

### **AI Communication Template**
```
"Here's my project vision (PRD.md), my current task (NEXT_TASK.md), 
where I left off (TASK_TRACKER.md), and all project files (PROJECT_FILES.md). 

Can you help me with [specific question] while ensuring 
we stay aligned with the vision?"
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips**

### **Keep It Simple**
- **Update TASK_TRACKER.md** every 30 minutes
- **Log errors immediately** - don't wait
- **Check alignment** when you feel stuck
- **Trust the flow** - it works

### **When to Update Each File**
- **NEXT_TASK.md** - When priorities change
- **TASK_TRACKER.md** - Throughout your work session
- **PRD.md** - When vision changes (rarely)
- **ERROR_LOGS.md** - When something breaks
- **PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md** - When requirements change
- **PROJECT_FILES.md** - When files are created, modified, or deleted

### **Signs You're Off Track**
- You haven't checked PRD.md in days
- You're working on tasks not in NEXT_TASK.md
- You keep making the same errors
- You can't remember where you left off

---

## ðŸŒŸ **Why This Works**

### **Clear Decision Points**
- **What to work on** (NEXT_TASK.md)
- **Where you are** (TASK_TRACKER.md)
- **Why you're doing it** (PRD.md)
- **What went wrong** (ERROR_LOGS.md)
- **How things changed** (PROJECT_EVOLUTION.md)

### **Built-in Alignment Checks**
- **Vision alignment** before major decisions
- **Error pattern recognition** to prevent repeats
- **Evolution tracking** to understand changes
- **Progress visibility** to stay motivated

### **AI-Friendly Structure**
- **Clear context** for AI assistants
- **Structured information** they can understand
- **Alignment checks** they can help with
- **Progress tracking** they can reference
